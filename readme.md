# Game Development with MERN Stack

This repository provides a guide and resources for developing games using the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- Node.js and npm
- MongoDB
- Git

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**
    ```bash

    ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
    ```bash
    npm install
    cd client
    npm install
    cd ..
    ```

3. **Set Up Environment Variables**
    Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following:
    ```
    MONGO_URI=<your-mongodb-connection-string>
    PORT=5000
    ```

4. **Run the Application**
    - Start the backend server:
      ```bash
      npm run server
      ```

      npm start
      ```

5. **Access the Application**
    Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.

## Features

- **Backend**: Node.js with Express for API development.
- **Frontend**: React for building the game interface.
- **Database**: MongoDB for storing game data.

## Development Workflow

1. **Backend Development**
    - Add new API routes in the `routes` folder.
    - Implement game logic in the `controllers` folder.

2. **Frontend Development**
    - Create React components in the `client/src/components` folder.
    - Use state management for game logic.

3. **Database**
    - Define schemas in the `models` folder.
    - Use Mongoose for database operations.
