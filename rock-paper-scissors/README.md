# Rock Paper Scissors Game

## Overview

This project is a simple interactive implementation of the classic **Rock Paper Scissors** game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The user plays against the computer, and the interface displays scores, results, and game rules.

## How It Works

- **Gameplay:**  
    - The user selects one of three options: Rock (✊), Paper (✋), or Scissors (✌️).
    - The computer randomly selects its choice.
    - The winner is determined based on the classic rules:
        - Rock beats Scissors
        - Scissors beats Paper
        - Paper beats Rock
        - If both choices are the same, it's a tie.

- **Score Tracking:**  
    - Both the player's and computer's scores are displayed and updated after each round.

- **Result Display:**  
    - After each round, a message shows both choices and the result (win, lose, or tie).

- **Rules Panel:**  
    - A panel is available to explain the rules of the game, which can be toggled on or off.

## Theoretical Background

**Rock Paper Scissors** is a hand game usually played between two people. Each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with an outstretched hand. The possible outcomes are:

- **Rock** (a fist)
- **Paper** (an open hand)
- **Scissors** (a fist with the index and middle fingers extended, forming a V)

The rules are simple:
- Rock crushes Scissors
- Scissors cut Paper
- Paper covers Rock

If both players choose the same shape, the game is tied and usually replayed.

This game is often used as a simple decision-making tool or just for fun.

## Project Structure

- **HTML:**  
    - Defines the layout, including the game area, score display, result message, and rules panel.

- **CSS:**  
    - Styles the game for a visually appealing and responsive interface.

- **JavaScript:**  
    - Handles game logic, score updates, result display, and toggling the rules panel.

## How to Play

1. Open the HTML file in your browser.
2. Click on Rock, Paper, or Scissors to make your choice.
3. The computer will automatically make its choice.
4. The result and updated scores will be displayed.
5. Click the "RULES" button to view or hide the game rules.

## Customization

You can easily extend or modify this project by:
- Changing the UI styles in the CSS section.
- Adding more features, such as a reset button or sound effects.
